## Including in other plugins
Integrate the virion itself into your plugin or you could also use it as a composer library by running the command below:

`composer require nhanaz/libbedrock`

This library supports being included as a [virion](https://github.com/poggit/support/blob/master/virion.md).

If you use [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io) to build your plugin, you can add it to your `.poggit.yml` like so:

```yml
--- # Poggit-CI Manifest. Open the CI at https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/YourGithubUserName/YourPluginName
build-by-default: true
branches:
- master
projects:
  YourPluginName:
    path: ""
    libs:
      - src: NhanAZ/libBedrock/libBedrock
        version: x.y.z
...

```
